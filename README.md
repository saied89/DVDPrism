The purpose of this project is an android application that helps users keep track of all DVD releases. It consists of an android app and a Ktor backend. The backend will pull data from several sources, infuse them and present the data to the application through a REST API.

I'm a professional Android developer. I made this project to practice and apply the latest technologies, tools, etc that emerge in the Androidosphere away from constraints of professional projects while also dipping my toes in the backend developement, DevOps and (hopefully) Vector graphics. I want to investigate if all these cool new technologies play well together, What are the challenging bits and what workarounds are available.

There are several broad goals in this project of which some are achieved, others are close to compeletion while others will be persued in phase 2 after the release of the application.

## Transition APIs and the new MotionLayout

## Complete Architectural components

## Coroutines & networking with Ktor Client

## Code sharing between app and backend through a common module

## Complete code coverage and integration of CI/CD

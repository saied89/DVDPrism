If you prefer to watch movies in your home, you'll have to ignore the hype around the newest theatrical releases and follow the DVD releases instead. If so this application is for you.

This project will helps users keep track of all DVD releases. It consists of an android app and a Ktor backend. The backend will pull data from sources, merge them and deliver data to the application through a REST API. The app will present the data to the user in a stylish and modern manner while also having some side functions.

Besides being a movie fan I'm a professional Android developer. I made this project to practice and apply the latest technologies, tools, etc that emerge in the Androidosphere away from constraints of professional projects while also dipping my toes in the backend developement, DevOps and Vector graphics. I want to investigate if all these cool new technologies play well together, What are the challenging bits and what workarounds are available.

There are several broad goals in this project of which some are achieved, others are close to compeletion while others will be persued in phase 2 after the release of the application.

                Forrest Tucker (Robert Redford) has been on the wrong side of the law since he was a teen. He grew into a career bank robber who broke out of prison 18 times, including a daring escape from San Quentin at age 70. The film covers his twilight years, and an unprecedented string of daring heists that confound authorities and enchants the public. Wrapped up in this chase are a detective (Casey Affleck) who becomes captivated with Forrestâ€™s commitment to his craft, and a woman (Sissy Spacek) who loves him in spite of his chosen profession.
